Mobile cloud project description
Prof. Dr. Michael I. Schumacher & Stefan Eggenschwiler

The goal of this project is to develop a mobile application in Android, and, in a second
step, to store the app data inside the cloud. For this, you will use Android and Firebase.
Every group of two students implements a different application and is evaluated on the
application code.

Application features:
- User interface allowing to:
o Show the dataset information
o Change/Delete this information
o Add new data
- Action bar (or navigation drawer using fragments)
- Settings, allowing to display an About information (information about the App)
and other useful settings
- Correct management of activities
- Correct navigation hierarchy
- Storing data on the phone using Google’s Room API (1st part of project)
- Storing data inside Google cloud using Firebase (2nd part of project)
- Other useful features to make your application coherent and attractive
- The code must be very well self-documented and self-explaining
