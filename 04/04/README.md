# Project goals
## Initial scope
 - [x] User interface allowing to
	 - [x] Show the dataset information
	 - [x] Change/Delete this information
	 - [x] Add new data
 - [x] Navigation drawer
 - [x] Settings
	 - [x] About information (information about the App)
	 - [x] other useful settings : application language, database restoration
 - [x] Storing data on the phone using Googleâ€™s Room API (1st part of project)

## "Nice to have"
 - [x] Select picture from phone camera (if present) or gallery
 - [x] Integration of Google Maps SDK
 - [x] Firebase storage : currently off, through hard-coded boolean switch `CLOUD_ACTIVE`. We realized that cloud storage did not make sense without cloud database, so we turned it off for now.
